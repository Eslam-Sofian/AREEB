Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1- Java Development Kit (JDK): Selenium is primarily used with Java, so make sure you have the JDK installed. You can download it from the Oracle website or use OpenJDK.

2- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): You can use any Java IDE of your choice. Popular options include Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA, but I prefare Eclipse.

3- WebDriver: Selenium requires a WebDriver for the specific browser you want to automate. Common options include:

- Chrome WebDriver for Google Chrome.
- GeckoDriver for Mozilla Firefox.
- Edge WebDriver for Microsoft Edge.
Download the WebDriver executable for your browser and make sure it's available in your system's PATH.

4- Selenium Java Bindings: You'll need to add the Selenium Java bindings to your project. You can download them from the Selenium official website. Alternatively, you can use a build tool like Maven or Gradle to manage dependencies.
5- Open pulled project from github repository.
6- Run order class as testNG test.
- in case you didn't find run as testNG test go to help from top menu in Eclipse then click on Eclipse marketplace then search on TestNG and install it to your Eclipse
